A port of the 1975 MECC version of The Oregon Trail, written in Bash.

Done as an exercise after too much time spent away from Linux.

In this port, I have kept most of the original wording and punctuation and only took the decision to change where I felt that it improved the interaction with the player by avoiding confusion.

# Game Information
This program simulates a trip over the Oregon Trail from
Independence, Missouri to Oregon City, Oregon in 1847.
Your family of five will cover the 2000 mile Oregon Trail
in 5-6 months --- if you make it alive.

You had saved $900 to spend for the trip, and you've just
paid $200 for a wagon.
You will need to spend the rest of your money on the
following items:

- Oxen - you can spend $200-$300 on your team.
The more you spend, the faster you'll go
because you'll have better animals.

- Food - the more you have, the less chance there
is of getting sick.

- Ammunition - $1 buys a belt of 50 bullets.
You will need bullets for attacks by animals.

- Clothing - this is especially important for the cold
weather you will encounter when crossing
the mountains.

- Miscellaneous supplies - this includes medicine and
other things you will need for sickness
and emergency repairs.

You can spend all your money before you start your trip -
or you can save some of your cash to spend at forts along
the way when you run low.  However, items cost more at
the forts.  You can also go hunting along the way to get
more food.

This game is competely text-driven through your keyboard.
Whenever you have to use your trusty rifle along the way,
you will see words: type BANG.  The faster you type
in the word 'BANG' and hit the 'Return' key, the better
luck you'll have with your gun.

When asked to enter money amounts, don't use a '$'.

Good luck!!!
