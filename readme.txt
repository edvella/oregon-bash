A port of the 1975 MECC version of The Oregon Trail, written in Bash.

Done as an exercise after too much time spent away from Linux.

In this port, I have kept most of the original wording and punctuation and only took the decision to change where I felt that it improved the interaction with the player by avoiding confusion.

Music played during development:
Tchaikovsky: Swan Lake - performed by the London Symphony Orchestra (1976)
...And Justice for All - Metallica (1988)
